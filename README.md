## OpenSearch Project Ansible-Playbook

A community repository for Ansible Playbook of OpenSearch Project.

## OpenSearch Installation with Dashboards

This ansible playbook supports the following,

- Can be deployed on baremetal and VMs(AWS EC2)
- Supports most popular **Linux distributions**(Centos7, RHEL7, Amazon Linux2, Ubuntu 20.04)
- Install and configure the Apache2.0 opensource OpenSearch
- Configure TLS/SSL for OpenSearch transport layer(Nodes to Nodes communication) and REST API layer
- Generate self-signed certificates to configure TLS/SSL for opensearch
- Configure the Internal Users Database with limited users and user-defined passwords
- Install and configure the Apache2.0 opensource OpenSearch Dashboards

### Prerequisite

- **Ansible 2.9+**
- **Java 8**

### Configure

Refer the file `inventories/opensearch/group_vars/all/all.yml` to change the default values.

For example if we need to increase the java memory heap size for opensearch,

    xms_value: 8
    xmx_value: 8

In `inventories/opensearch/hosts` file, you can configure the node details.
`ansible_host` is used for ansible to connect the nodes to run this playbook.
`ip` is used in OpenSearch and Dashboards configuration.

In AWS EC2,
```
  os1 ansible_host=<Elastic/Public IP> address ansible_user=root ip=<Private IP address>
```

#### Multi-node Installation

By default, this playbook will install five nodes opensearch cluster with respective roles (3 master, 5 data and 2 ingest nodes).

```
os1 ansible_host=10.0.1.1 ip=10.0.1.1 roles=data,master
os2 ansible_host=10.0.1.2 ip=10.0.1.2 roles=data,master
os3 ansible_host=10.0.1.3 ip=10.0.1.3 roles=data,master
0s4 ansible_host=10.0.1.4 ip=10.0.1.4 roles=data,ingest
os5 ansible_host=10.0.1.5 ip=10.0.1.5 roles=data,ingest
```

**Note**: You need to add additional nodes details in `inventories/opensearch/hosts` file for creating opensearch cluster with different node sizes.

For example, if you want to create seven nodes cluster with two additional data nodes (`os6` and `os7`) then you need to include the below entries.

```
os6 ansible_host=10.0.1.6 ip=10.0.1.6 roles=data
os7 ansible_host=10.0.1.7 ip=10.0.1.5 roles=data
```

You have to mention the opensearch node [roles](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/cluster/) details in `roles` variable.

#### Single Node Installation

For single node installation, you need to change the `cluster_type` variable in inventory file `inventories/opensearch/group_vars/all/all.yml`

```
cluster_type: single-node
```

### Install


    # Deploy with ansible playbook - run the playbook as root
    ansible-playbook -i inventories/opensearch/hosts opensearch.yml --extra-vars "admin_password=Test@123 kibanaserver_password=Test@6789"

You should set the reserved users(`admin` and `kibanaserver`) password using `admin_password` and `kibanaserver_password` variables.

It will install and configure the opensearch. Once the deployment completed, you can access the opensearch Dashboards with user `admin` and password which you provided for variable `admin_password`.
