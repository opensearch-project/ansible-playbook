# Overwrite demo configurations with your own

# To override demo configurations, you can use your own configuration files.
# Place them in the "files" directory. Specify the path to the files

# By default, if the /tmp/opensearch-nodecerts directory with certificates
# exists on the server from which the playbook is launched, it is assumed
# that the configuration has not changed and some settings are not copied
# to the target servers.
#
# Conversely, if the /tmp/opensearch-nodecerts directory does not exist on
# the server from which the playbook is launched, then new certificates and
# settings are generated and they are copied to the target servers.
#
# If you use this repository not only for the initial deployment of the
# cluster, but also for its automatic configuration via CI/CD, then new
# certificates will be generated every time the pipeline is launched,
# overwriting existing ones, which is not always necessary if the cluster is
# already in production.
#
# When iac_enable enabling, and all the cluster servers have all the necessary
# certificates, they will not be copied again. If at least on one server (for
# example, when adding a new server to the cluster) if there is not at least one
# certificate from the list, then all certificates on all cluster servers will
# be updated
#
# Also, if the option is enabled, the settings files will be updated with each
# execution (previously, the settings were updated only if the
# /tmp/opensearch-nodecerts directory was missing on the server from which the
# playbook was launched and new certificates were generated)
iac_enable: false
